      {
        "question": "What are the lead responsibility hierarchies in railway communication?",
        "answer": "ECO over signaler, Signaler over everyone else, SPM over Shunters, West End man over other shunters or drivers. Always respect the established communication chain of command."

        "question": "What critical steps must be taken during an emergency group call?",
        "answer": "1. Press the red button on GSMR radio, 2. State 'This is an emergency call', 3. Provide head code, 4. Give location of incident, 5. Describe nature of incident, 6. Specify affected lines, 7. Identify lines to be blocked, 8. Request necessary emergency services, 9. Provide contact number, 10. Confirm message is repeated back correctly."

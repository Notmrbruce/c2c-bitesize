      },
      {
        "question": "Why must you check the Roster notice case?",
        "answer": "To check you are on the right job, to see if your job has AW (Additional Work), and to check your next shift."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why must you check the Late notice case?",
        "answer": "To check for any speed restrictions, ice mode activation, and safety of the line notices."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why must you check the Train crew notice case?",
        "answer": "To check for any traction notices, any notices moved from the late notice case, and any non-safety of the line notices."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why must you check the Incident notice case?",
        "answer": "To check on any latest operational incidents."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why must you check the Low adhesion notice case?",
        "answer": "To check the colour of the low adhesion day and areas treated by RHTT (Rail Head Treatment Train)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What information would you find in the late notice case?",
        "answer": "Emergency speed restrictions (ESRs), ice mode activation, any other safety of the line notices (e.g., colour of low adhesion day), and a register."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long will a notice be posted in the late notice case?",
        "answer": "Posted for 72 hours. Emergency Speed Restrictions (ESRs) can be re-issued or entered in WON (Weekly Operating Notice), after which they become Temporary Speed Restrictions (TSRs)."
      },

        "question": "What information would you find in the train crew notice case?",

      {
        "question": "What happens to Emergency Speed Restrictions (ESRs) after the 72-hour period in the late notice case?",
        "answer": "They can either be re-issued for another 72 hours, or they can be entered into the Weekly Operating Notice (WON), at which point they become Temporary Speed Restrictions (TSRs)."
      },
      {
        "question": "If you missed checking a notice case when signing on, what should you do?",
        "answer": "You should inform your supervisor immediately and check the missed notice case before commencing any duties. Operating without awareness of relevant notices can compromise safety."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between 'safety of the line' and 'non-safety of the line' notices?",
        "answer": "Safety of the line notices directly impact safe train operation and infrastructure (like speed restrictions, ice mode activation), while non-safety of the line notices are important operational information but don't directly impact immediate safe movement of trains."
      },
      {
        "question": "What action should you take if you find a traction notice in the train crew notice case that affects your route?",
        "answer": "You should read it thoroughly, understand how it impacts your journey, and adjust your driving technique accordingly. If you're unsure about the implications, seek clarification from a supervisor before proceeding."

        "answer": "All accidents and near misses at the depot must be reported in the first instance to the SPM (Senior Production Manager) who will: 1) arrange for all movements to be stopped if required, 2) arrange for any necessary medical attention, and 3) record the incident in the accident book kept in the front office."
      },
      {
        "question": "How should you handle a situation where you witness someone acting in an unsafe manner?",
        "answer": "Challenge them if you feel it's safe to do so. Call the Signaller if on track or SPM/Depot Manager in the depot (block lines if needed) and advise them to call British Transport Police (BTP)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are your responsibilities if you discover unauthorized persons on a train within a depot?",

Litter pickers can be used if the item is within reach and you have EXPRESS PERMISSION from the signaller."
